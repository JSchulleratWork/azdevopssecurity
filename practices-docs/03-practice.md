# #3 Understand the Main Security Concepts in Azure DevOps
- You can control permissions on almost anything in Azure DevOps
- Some permissions are on Project level and some on Collection Level
- Some artifacts have permissions set directly e.g. Service Connections and Secure Files
- Permissions are automatically set based on the security group that you add users to and can be overridden on the specific level
- Access levels control access to product features (Basic, VS Enterprise, or Stakeholder) 
- Limit the number of Admins!
