# #14 Manage Extensions
- Extensions are great and helps solve a lot of thing for the creator of Pipelines, but they need to be managed
- Consider the security implications of an extension before "releasing" it for use inside your organization
- Extensions has to be approved by Collection Administrator, by limiting the number of Collection Administrators you can ensure a uniform process on approving ned extensions
- If you build and use your own Extensions make that you have proper security scanning and review in place
    - Define a plan for maintaining your Extensions just like any other software you build.
