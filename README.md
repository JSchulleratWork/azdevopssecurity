# Azure DevOps: Recommended Practices for Secure Pipelines

## Introduction
This repos started after a customer presentation on this topic. After digging into it I found that I could keep on adding content related to this topic. These are my personal recommendations! No guarantees of any kind provided! 

I would love to get feedback on the content and I am looking expading and updating it. So please add your comments/issues and I will look into it when I have time :-)

Pipelines in the context of Azure DevOps covers both build (CI) and release pipelines (CD). Most of the stuff here is related to Azure DevOps when deploying to Azure, but might be applicable in many other situations as well. Feel free to use the information anyway you want - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE)

For a general introduction to the security in the Azure DevOps service please see the [security whitepaper](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/articles/team-services-security-whitepaper?view=azure-devops).
